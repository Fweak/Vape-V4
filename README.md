# Vape V4

**Disclaimer:** The purpose of this project is for educational purposes only. The author does not promote any form of cheating and will not be held responsible for any consequences resulting from its use.

This project is a modified version of Kangaroo's Vape crack, which was no longer functional. The goal of this project is to provide an updated emulator for Vape's server.

## Features

- Supports Vape V4 Forge for versions 1.7, 1.8, and 1.12
- Includes all modules
- Supports saving configuration and editing profiles

## Limitations

- Currently does not support Lunar Client or any custom client.
  - If you would like to appear as if you are using Lunar client, we recommend using [Lilith](https://lilith.rip/), which has a Lunar spoofer.
- Vanilla is not fully supported
  - There is a mapping issue that has not yet been resolved, but it works on forge.
